    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Hospice Alliance: Payment Form Integration</h3>
    <p>
      In my community-based learning class, my group helped Hospice Alliance, a local non-profit, integrate a payment form on their website. This project improved their donation process by making it more accessible and secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I applied skills in web development, payment gateway integration, and UI design to ensure a smooth, user-friendly experience. The project was a great opportunity to contribute to a meaningful cause while enhancing my technical abilities.
    </p>

    <h3>ETL Data Pipeline: Visual Basic Form</h3>
    <p>
      As part of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project, I created a mock form using Visual Basic. The backend of the system was coded to take the form's input data and load it into a file stored on the computer’s file explorer. This demonstrated my understanding of how to handle data input and automate the data extraction and storage process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project gave me hands-on experience with data extraction, file management, and automation, and reinforced my ability to streamline processes and manage data efficiently.
